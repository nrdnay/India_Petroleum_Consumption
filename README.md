# ABOUT THE PROJECT
In this project, the consumption of petroleum products in India was examined, a consumption forecast model was created, model performance was measured and future consumption of petroleum products was estimated.
The dataset containing the consumption of petroleum products in India belongs to the period April 2020 - February 2023.
